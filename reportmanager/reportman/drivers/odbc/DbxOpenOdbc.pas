// Explanation of _MULTIROWS_FETCH_
// Support for ODBC "block fetching" (SQL_ATTR_ROW_ARRAY_SIZE)
// Not all ODBC drivers support this mode (SQL_GD_BLOCK).
// We automatically query the ODBC driver to check if it supports this option,
// so you can safely include this option and block fetching will be used if
// the ODBC driver supports it.
// Even if the ODBC driver indicates that it supports block fetching,
// block fetching cannot be used if there are any late-bound fields in the query
// (large fields e.g. MEMO, BLOB are normally late-bound).
// If you have late-bound fields, and you want to use block fetching, you will need
// to use _MIXED_FETCH_ option in addition to _MULTIROWS_FETCH_ (see below).

{.$DEFINE _MIXED_FETCH_}
{$IFDEF _MIXED_FETCH_}
  {$IFNDEF _MULTIROWS_FETCH_}
    {$MESSAGE  Warn '_MIXED_FETCH_ ignored because _MULTIROWS_FETCH_ not defined'}
  {$ENDIF}
{$ENDIF}
// Explanation of _MIXED_FETCH_
// (This option only applies if _MULTIROWS_FETCH_ is also set.)
// Set the _MIXED_FETCH_ option if you you want to use block cursors for queries
// with late-bound fields (i.e. large fields).
// For fetching late-bound columns the following ODBC API functions are used:
// SqlBindCol + SqlSetPos + SqlGetData.
// If you have late-bound fields and you want to use block fetching,
// it is necessary to use a static cursor (SQL_CURSOR_STATIC), whereas normally
// we use the more efficient forward-only cursor (SQL_CURSOR_FORWARD_ONLY).
// But with the forward-only cursor, block fetching is not possible if the are
// and late-bound columns.
// You can dynamically control this parameter by using the connection parameter
// coMixedFetch. You can change this parameter before execution of query.
//
// Warnings:
//
// - Static and keyset-driven cursors increase the usage of tempdb. Static server cursors
//   build the entire cursor in tempdb; keyset-driven cursors build the keyset in tempdb.
//
// - Some ODBC drivers incorrectly handle this mode of operation.
//   We have detected bugs with the following drivers:
//   PervasiveSQL ODBC, Version: '08.10.0117 017'.
//   Microsoft SQL 2000, version '08.00.0194'.
//   (In Developer Edition version '08.00.0384' this error is already not present).
//
// - When the ODBC driver does not support SQL_GD_ANY_COLUMN, and you have large fields,
//   it is more efficient to specify the simple fields before large fields (MEMO, BLOB)
//   in the select statment, because all fields beyond the first large field will be late-bound.
//
// You can adjust support of this adjustment separately for each driver.
// Look for procedure RetrieveDriverName.
//

{$DEFINE _RegExprParser_}
{$IFDEF _DisableRegExprParser_}
  {$UNDEF _RegExprParser_}
{$ENDIF}
// Explanation of _RegExprParser_
// For Informix multi-part names, this option must be defined
// For any other RDBMS, can be defined not not essential
// When defined, multi-part table names are parsed using DbxObjectParser
// (which itself uses RegExpr module by Andrey V. Sorokin / Henry Spencer)

{$DEFINE _InternalCloneConnection_}
{$IFDEF _DisableInternalCloneConnection_}
  {$UNDEF _InternalCloneConnection_}
{$ENDIF}
// Explanation of _InternalCloneConnection_
// If the DBMS limits the number simultaneous statements per connection,
// DbExpress will clone the connection externally where necessary.
// If _InternalCloneConnection_ is defined, we report to DbExpress that
// statements per connection are unlimited, and automatically clone a
// new connection internally where necessary. This is particularly useful
// for prompted connects, because we hold the connection string returned by
// the first connect, and we use this for the subsequent cloned connects, so
// the user is prompted only once for connect info. (This is also needed for
// old version of DbExpress which query max simultaneous statements before
// any connect, but Borland fixed this in Delphi 6 SP2.)

  Kylix / Delphi DbExpress driver for ODBC Version 3 drivers
  (Also works with ODBC Version 2).

  Normally SqlExpress loads the driver DLL dynamically (ie dbxoodbc.dll),
  according to TSQLConnection.LibraryName.

  Alternatively if you add this unit to a USES anywhere in your project,
  the driver will be statically linked into your program and SqlExpress will
  ignore TSQLConnection.LibraryName. (This magic is achieved by the call to
  SqlExpr.RegisterDbXpressLib in the initialization section of this unit, but
  it only works in Windows - in Kylix SqlExpr.RegisterDbXpressLib is not defined)

  The project source for DLL version is 'dbxoodbc.dpr', which just
  USES this module and EXPORTS the getSQLDriverODBC function.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Steps to manually install new DBExpress driver
  (This is not really necessary - it just makes it easier to change drivers, by
  selecting TSQLConnection.DriverName and TSQLConnection.ConnectionName drop-down)

  1. Retrieve DbExpress INI file names from registry
     '\Software\Borland\DBExpress' Value 'Driver Registry File'
     (The default ini file names will be:
      C:\Program Files\Common Files\Borland Shared\DBExpress\dbxdrivers.ini)
      C:\Program Files\Common Files\Borland Shared\DBExpress\dbxconnections.ini)

  2. In dbxdrivers.ini file

  a. Add line to '[INSTALLEDDRIVERS]' section
       drivername=1 (eg 'Dbx Open Odbc Driver=1') (The driver name can be any name you like)

  b. Add new [drivername] section ie [Dbx Open Odbc Driver], with following 3 lines
       LibraryName=dbxoodbc.dll        (Not case-sensitive in Windows)
       GetDriverFunc=getSQLDriverODBC  (NB This is case-sensitive, even in Windows)
       VendorLib=ODBC32.DLL            (Value not actually used by this driver - ODBC32.DLL is hard-coded)

  3. In dbxconnections.ini file

  a. Add '[ConnectionName]' section with following 4 lines
       DriverName=Dbx Open Odbc Driver (or whatever you called it in dbxdrivers.ini)
       Database=ODBC DSN name, or ODBC connection string, or ? for Driver Prompt
       User_Name=user name (this can be ommitted)
       Password=password (this can be ommitted)

  b. You can have as many different [ConnectionName] sections as you like, so
     you can pre-configure several ODBC connection settings.

  If you skip the install, you must set TSQLConnection properties
  before you connect:
    .LibaryName = dbxoodbc.dll (must be fully qualified if not on the search path)
    .GetDriverFunc = getSQLDriverODBC (NB this is case-sensitive)
    .VendorLib = ODBC32.DLL
    .Params - As described dbxconnections.ini above - Database is required, others optional
}

{
  Note on Error checking:

  In this driver almost every function that implements the various
  DBXpress interfaces is guarded by "try / except".

  If an error occurs, an EDbxError exception of one of the following sub-types is rasied:

    EDbxOdbcError: An error was returned from an ODBC function call
    EDbxInvalidCall: The function or its parameters are not valid
    EDbxNotSupported: The function or its parameters are valid but not yet supported by this driver
    EDbxInternalError: Some other error occurred with this module

  Control then goes to the Except routine in the relevant interface functuon.

  If EDbxNotSupported can happen, this is always checked first, and the
  function returns DBXERR_NOTSUPPORTED, so the caller can take action as necessary.

  Otherwise the EDbxError handler gets invoked (because EDbxError is the parent
  class of the other 3 exception types). The handler retrieves the Exception message,
  saves it in an instance variable (occasionally some other info is also saved),
  and then the function returns MaxReservedStaticErrors + 1.
  The caller can get the error text (via GetErrorMessage/Len) and raise its own
  error or ignore, as appropriate.

  The reason for raising and trapping EDbxError, rather than simply returning
  non SQL_SUCCESS code, is that the calling programs may not always check
  the function return code, or it may check for error code but retrieve the error
  message from the wrong interface. So by raising exception at the point of
  error, the IDE halts on the exception during source debugging, and this makes
  it much easier to trace errors.

  Note to contributors

  DO NOT REFORMAT EXISTING CODE

  Not only is it impolite, but (more importantly) it obscures the 'real' changes.
  Also, it is a waste of time, because I will change any reformatting back again.

  Here are the formatting rules --

  As closely as possible, follow Borland formatting conventions.
  For this, run code though DelForExp (Delphi Formatting Expert),
  set with "Borland Style", but wrap lines at position 100.

  Variable naming and capitalization:
  Use lowercase for reserved words (as per Borland standard) [N.B. "string" is a reserved word!]
  Use "infix caps" (also known as "Pascal capitialzation") for identifiers.
  In this convention, each word within variable starts with uppercase, example, MyVariableName.
  In the standard used in this project, acronyms are treated as single words,
  example - MySqlOdbcDbxVariableName (NOT MySQLODBCDBXVariableName)
  Common type names are treated as single words, not two words,
  example, Smallint, Timestamp (not SmallInt, TimeStamp)
  American English spellings are used, not British English,
  examples, Color, License, Synchronize (not Colour, Licence (as a noun), Synchronise).

  Exceptions to "infix" caps:
  Our class member variables begin lowercase "f"
  (Because then the difference between a method and a field is more distinct)
  Our procedure local variables may begin lowercase or uppercase (eg i, aTempVar, or TempVar)

  Where names come from a pre-defined header, (eg, Interface method names in DBXpress.pas,
  or names in OdbcApi.pas), we always follow capitalization of the header file, even if it
  is inconsistent (eg ISQLCommand.close, ISQLCommand.getParameter, ISQLCommand.GetOption).

Version 2.01, 2002-11-01 (Vadim Lopushansky)
------------------------

Edward> + below means I have included Vadim's change,
Edward> - means I have not

  + Change to support Delphi7. See block: {$IFDEF _D7UP_}.
  + Change to support INFORMIX (tested on version IDS 7.31 TD3).
  + Change to support ThinkSQL (tested on version 0.4.07 beta. http://thinksql.com/).
  + Change to detect database types for Multiplatform DataDirect ODBC Drivers
    (http://www.datadirect-technologies.com)
  - Change to detect database type method TSqlConnectionOdbc.RetrieveDriverName.
    For detecting usage specific RDMS query.
    Edward> I have not included this:
    Edward> I think it is better to use SQLGetInfoString(SQL_DBMS_NAME) instead
  + Change to remapping Int64 to BCD
    (optional. Connection parameter: "Database"="...;MapInt64ToBcd=1"
    or "Custom String"="...;MapInt64ToBcd=1")
  + Change to remapping small BCD to native
    (optional. Connection parameter: "Database"="...;MapSmallBcdToNative=1"
    or "Custom String"="...;MapSmallBcdToNative=1"))
    Is problem in editing controls when native type length is more then BCD data type length.
    For editing you mast usage controls with format string...
  + Change for addition of possibility of disconnecting of support of the metadata.
    Is used in case of availability of errors in the ODBC driver.
    For disconnecting the metadata it is necessary to add to connection line Metadata=0
    (Connection parameter: "Database"="...;Metadata=0"  or "Custom String"="...;Metadata=1").
  + Change to updating BCD values when DecimalSeparator <> '.'
  + Change to reading of PK_INDEX from metadata (Calculating fPkNameLenMax).
    For an example look: ($DELPHI$)\Demos\Db\DbxExplorer\dbxexplorer.dpr
    (Read PKEY_NAME error).
    All metadata fields returned length more 0.
  + Change in %Metadata%.getColumnLength:
    Adapting to calculate visible of columns in SqlExpr.pas type.
    For an example look: ($DELPHI$)\Demos\Db\DbxExplorer\dbxexplorer.dpr
    (Read procedure parameters position error).
  + Change to remove warnings and hints.
  + Change to Access Violation code
    (When returned column precision from LongWord to Smallint type when
    precission is more High(smallint), ... )
  + Change to setting metadata position for bad odbc driver
    (Read of columns information with the "Easysoft Interbase ODBC Driver"
     version 1.00.01.67 on example "dbxexplorer.dpr").
  + Changes when QuoteChar=' '.
    In this situation QuoteChar must be empty (''). (MSSQL, Informix,...)
    ( Edward> ???Ed>Vad/All: But I think MSSQL uses doublequote char ("), not blank. )
  + Change to support Trim of Fixed Char when connection parameter "Trim Char" is True
    or when connection parameter: Database=...;TrimChar=1.
    The mode 1 - allows to work in the mode compatible
    with the "BDE" mode for "FixedChar" of strings.
    Mode 0 - is default - the strings of fixed width are not truncating.
  + New SchemaFilter parameter in login parameter "Custom String".
    This parameter allows to filter the metadata of the only current scheme.
    By default filtering is on for: Oracle.
    If it does not settle - disable filtering through the parameter of connection:
    Custom String=...;SchemaFilter=0
  + Change to autodetect ODBC driver level mode 2.
  + Change to autodetect SupportsCatalog Options.
    Warning: Some of the driver is illconditioned work with this option.
    For example do not return an error at installation of a unknown of the catalog.
    From behind it the procedure of installation of the catalog was received
    cumbersome and depending from database.
    But you have possibility of load shedding of support of the catalog.
    Read further about parameter of Catalog...
  + The possibility is supplemented to disable support of the
    'Catalog option. Database=...;Catalog=0
  + Change to increase of speed of blob fetching.
    Database or "Custom String" parameter "BlobChunkSize".
    In Bytes. Define size blob buffer for loop-fetching.
    The size of a cache can be synchronized with a size of a cache assigned in the ODBC driver.
  + Vadim> ???Vad>All: Change to support Odbc driver attribute SQL_ATTR_PACKET_SIZE.
    Edward> Very good! Although I think it is not advisable to ever change this,
    Edward> Borland has seen fit to add it as an option, so we should implement it.
    For support this attribute you must define value it parameter in
    "Custom String" (Delphi 7) or "Database" (Delphi 6, 7)
    "Custom String"="...;ConPacketSize=8192";
    Database="..;ConPacketSize=8192"
    ConPacketSize should not be less than 4096. The upper range is defined by the driver.
  - Database or "Custom String" parameter "DriverLevel"
    user defined ODBC driver level mode.
    Edward> Now removed - we now auto-detect driver level
  - Change in ParseTableName for parsing in informix ...
    Warning: Probably and for other database servers it is necessary to change
    in view of their format of the job(definition) of a full name of the table.
  + Ignoring of exceptions for want of indexes.
  + It is possible at call to the tables from other spaces (catalog, servers, references).
    (Edward> what do you mean?)
  + The possibility of the external definition of parameters of the driver
    is supplemented (Catalog,TrimChar,BlobChankSize).
      Examples:
        Delphi 7:
          Custom String=;Catalog=0;TrimChar=1;MapInt64ToBcd=1;SchemaFilter=1;
           Metadata=0;MapSmallBcdToNative=0;BlobChunkSize=32768
        Delphi 6 (also will work for Delphi 7):
          Database=DSN=DBDEMOS;UID=anonymous;PWD=unknown;
           TrimChar=1;BlobChunkSize=32768;ConPacketSize=3072
  - Change in "SqlExpr.pas" (Delphi 6,7):
     Change for reading of metadata when ODBC driver supported
     only one sql statement (MSSQL...).
     Change for support of the "connection string with prompt" '?'
     when need clone connection.
     For more detail look then file WhatNews.Txt.
    (Edward> I have done this by internally cloning the connection to handle this case)

{
Version 2.03, 2002-11-20 [ Edward Benson ]
------------------------
{
+ Split ISqlConnectionOdbc out to new module, DbxOpenOdbcInterface.
  This allows you to call the new methods of ISqlConnection,
  but without having to statically link in this module.
  (See QueryInterface comments in DbxOpenOdbcInterface on how to do this).

{+2.04 WhatNews}
(*
Version 2.04, 2002-12-19 [ Vadim V.Lopushansky pult@ukr.net ]
------------------------
+ Regular Expression Parser for Decode/Encode different DBMS object name format.
  Usage of this capability is adjusted(regulated) in parameter: {$define _RegExprParser_}
  It option can be turned off.

  If for your DBMS the off-gauge format of the definition of a full name of the object of DBMS,
  to you is necessary to describe the template of this format in the file "DbxObjectParser.pas".
  For debugging your template you can take advantage of an example from "RegExprParser.zip".

+ The capability of mapping of text fields into memo field is added as it is made in BDE:
  the fields with lengthy more than 256 characters are imaged on BlobMemo
  (optional. Connection parameter: "Database"="...;MapCharAsBDE=1"
    or "Custom String"="...;MapCharAsBDE=1")

Version 2.041, 2003-01-15 [ Dmitry Arefiev <darefiev@da-soft.com> ]
------------------------
+ Dmitry Arefiev <darefiev@da-soft.com>
  Some AV fixed in:
   TSqlCursorOdbc.BindResultSet
   TSqlCursorMetaDataIndexes.getString

Version 2.042, 2003-02-05 [ Vadim V.Lopushansky pult@ukr.net ]
------------------------
+ Alteration of implementation for ConnectionOptions
+ Cannot disconnect when inTransaction and fAutoCommitMode = SQL_AUTOCOMMIT_OFF.
   INFORMIX, MSACCESS:
   ERROR: SQLDisconnect(fhCon) returned error
   example:
    SQLCon.Open;
    SQLCon.StartTransaction(...;
    SQLQuery.Open;
    SQLCon.Close; // <- ERROR: SQLDisconnect(fhCon) returned error
+ The procedures are changed:
    - procedure FreeHCon
    - procedure FreeHStmt
      The clearing of the parameter SQLHDBC/SQLHSTMT is added.
+ Variables of types (SQLHDBC,SQLHSTMT) i compare with "SQL_NULL_HANDLE", instead of with "nil".
+ Optimization of speed by replacement:
  -----
    OdbcCheck(...)
  -----
  to
  -----
    if OdbcRetCode < > OdbcApi.SQL_SUCCESS then
      OdbcCheck(...)
  -----
+ Possibility of disconnecting of processing of a situation with hidden cloning of connections
  at limitation on quantity of simultaneous cursors. Search for an option
  $define _DisableOverloadCloningConnection_
+ The procedure "setParameter(.." are changed.
+ New Connection Option: "EmptyStrParam"
  Some ODBC of the driver do not handle a situation, when the string has zero length. For them it
  was necessary to write in the code following:
  procedure TForm1.DataSetBeforePost((DataSet: TDataSet);
  begin
    if Length(DataSet.FieldByName('customer').AsString) = 0 then
      DataSet.FieldByName('customer').Clear;
  end;
  To avoid it, now it is enough in connection string to indicate EmptyStrParam=0

Version 2.043, 2003-02-11 [ Vadim V.Lopushansky pult@ukr.net ]
------------------------
+ MSSQL SERVER: The situation with a mistake of cloning connection is corrected at connection
  through PIPE.
  ODBC Driver: SQL Server, version: 2000.81.9030.04.
  The problem consists that at connection through PIPE ODBC Driver returns a non-working line
  of connection (prevents option Network).

Version 2.05, 2003-04-04 [ Edward Benson ]
------------------------
+ Reformatting to agreed standard only.
  No functional changes.
  Release to CVS, to so we can see real functional DIFFs between next version and 2.043

Version 2.06, 2003-04-22 [ Edward Benson ]
------------------------
+ Use CompilerVersion instead of VERxxx to determine Compiler Version - this is more future-proof
+ Show Sql command text (if available) in GetErrorMessage
+ Show parameter values (if available) in GetErrorMessage
+ Show Sql Connect string (but with hidden password) in GetErrorMessage
+ Allow for Input, Output, Inout and Return parameters
+ Allow for transaction isolation level to be specified in ISQLConnection.beginTransaction
+ Reformat some exception messages
+ After SqlCloseCursor, add ODBC calls to UNBIND cursor bind vars and RESET parameters
+ Rollback outstanding transaction on disconnect, in case where concurrent statements
  per connection not unlimited (Vadim Lopushansky)
+ Conditional compilation for Kylix 3 [Kurt Fitzner / Stig Johansen]
+ TSqlCursorMetaData.isSearchable no longer raises error (Dmitry Arefiev)
+ Rename conditional (not) _DisableOverloadCloningConnection_ to _InternalCloneConnection_
+ Procedure FreeHCon changed from (out HCon: SqlHDbc) to (var HCon: SqlHDbc) [Stig Johansen]
+ Fix problem with TSqlCommandOdbc.SetParameter for fldFLOAT [Stig Johansen]
+ Do not call SQLGetStmtOption(SQL_ROWSET_SIZE) -- it does nothing [Stig Johansen]
+ In TSqlCommandOdbc.Destroy add check for statement already freed [Stig Johansen]

Version 2.07, 2003-05-07  [ Vadim V.Lopushansky pult@ukr.net ]
------------------------
+ Some critical errors have been corrected. (Uncorrect call FillChar, ...).
+ Added the possibility of watching of a sequence of calls of methods. See directive "_TRACE_CALLS_".
+ Tracing can be applied for watching problems with new drivers or DBMS.

Version 2.08, 2003-10-30  [ Vadim V.Lopushansky pult@ukr.net ]
------------------------
+ Fixed FetchLateBoundData and FetchLongData. There can be errors, when connection
  option coIgnoreUnknownFieldType is turned ON and query contained unsupported
  field type and fetching usage  LateBoundFound method for field located after
  unsupported field.
+ Fixed set SQL_VARCHAR parameter with length>255.
  AV: the reason - record outside the allocated memory.
+ Added access to INFORMIX LOB fields (not fully tested).
+ Fixed BcdToStr from FMTBcd.pas. See QC: 6169.
+ Release fhCon at disconnecting reconciled in impossibility of a reconnecting.
+ Fixed SQLite field mapping
+ Added checking of reasonableness of field size (returned from odbc driver) for next SQLTypes:
  SQL_CHAR, SQL_VARCHAR, ... SQL_BINARY, SQL_VARBINARY, SQL_LONGVARCHAR, SQL_WLONGVARCHAR
+ Added limitation to BindBufferSize for simple types:
  SQL_BINARY, SQL_VARBINARY,
  SQL_CHAR, SQL_VARCHAR ...
  It is handled only when fCommandBlobSizeLimitK<=0 (When it is possible to apply OdbcLateBound).
+ Added support in MSSQL sql_variant field type: SELECT value FROM "dbo"."sysproperties"
  But you can usage the next code for accessing:
  http://www.novicksoftware.com/UDFofWeek/Vol1/T-SQL-UDF-Volume-1-Number-12-udf_SQL_VariantToDatatypeName.htm
+ Set ConPacketSize for Cloned Cnnection
+ Fixed when transaction not supported
+ Fixed Connect: Removal of user options is made of a line of connection before its analysis.
+ Fixed Fetch Bytes Fields. Has been skipped FetchLateBoundData.
+ Added support of fldVARBYTES.
+ Fixed SortOrder. Must be in Upper Case.
+ Fixed indexing for TClientDataSet. Index cannot be unnamed (Very impotent for PK and Unique indexes).
+ Fixed Create RegExp Parser when QuoteChar = #0
+ Added support for:
    Pervasive.SQL (odbc ver: '8.10.117.17'),
    PostgreSQL (odbc ver: '7.03.01.00'),
    Cache`.
+ Added the opportunity to collect the driver in younger version Delphi for the senior version.
  Access to new opportunities now are accessible and in younger versions Delphi.
+ Added demo application: ODBC Explorer.

Version 2.09, 2003-10-31  [ Vadim V.Lopushansky pult@ukr.net ]
------------------------
+ Added usage of one buffer of memory for all types with a known size.
+ Added support BLOCK FETCHING options:
   eCommBlockRead (default=True),
   eCommRowsetSize (default in SqlExp=20).
  *****************************************************************
  *** Added support ODBC option: SQL_ATTR_ROW_ARRAY_SIZE !!!    ***
  *** It mapped to standard connection option: eCommRowsetSize. ***
  *****************************************************************
  Main changes: BindResultSet, Next, SetOption(eCommRowsetSize,...), connect

Version 2.010, 2003-11-06  [ Vadim V.Lopushansky pult@ukr.net ]
------------------------
+ Fixed procedure .next() for 'ARRAY FETCH' when the driver returns lines less than should.
  For example SAP DB ' ODBC Driver, ver: '7.04.03.00' always returns only one line at any
  set of rows.
+ Fixed TextFile(*.txt, *.csv) Table Name parsing. TableName can contain the '.'.
+ Fixed SQLite update/fetch BLOB (Memo) data types.
New/Changed options:
+ Added option "ENABLEBCD". In this option any BCD is mapped to Float.
+ Added mapping unsupported BCD Size to Float. See MaxFMTBcdDigits in FMTBcd.pas
+ Added MAXBCD option. For this option any BCD is mapped to BCD(32,??).
  It is possible for using in a case when the driver returns the incorrect column info.
+ Added check BCD Oveflow for procedure .getBCD(). Uncorrect values are trimmed.
+ Added default driver option. You can set default driver value at any time for any properties.
  For  make it you must set option value to 'X':
  example:
    SQLConnection1.SQLConnection.SetOption(
      TSQLConnectionOption(xeConnCustomInfo), Integer(PChar('MAXBCD=X')) );
New supported odbc drivers:
+ Added support for 'SAP DB ODBC Driver', ver: '7.04.03.00'
+ Added support for Firebird 'IBPhoenix ODBC Driver': http://www.ibphoenix.com/, ver: '01.00.0000'
  There were problems for the some Float fields.
+ Added support for 'XTG System Open Source Firebird, Interbase6 ODBC Driver':
  http://www.xtgsystems.com/, ver: '1.00.00.16'
  At use of this driver for function RowsAffected you will always receive 0 as the driver
  does not realize function SQLRowCount. From for it by transfer of changes to a DB by means
  of DSP you will receive mistakes: 'Record not found or changed by another user'. In part
  this problem can be solved as it is made in example OdbcExplor.dpr
  Also this driver returns bad columns Size(fColSize) for BCD field.
+ Added support for 'MERANT DBASE ODBC Driver', ver: '3.60.00.00'.
  Fixed .FetchIndexes() for it driver. The driver returns fields for an index as their concatenation
  (with a separator '+'). Example: 'fieldA+fieldB'.

Version 2.011, 2003-12-09   [ Vadim V.Lopushansky pult@ukr.net ]
-------------------------
+ Parse ConnectionString connection option (Delphi 7) and also the normal connection string,
  and if they BOTH contain "DATABASE=" we use replace the database value with
  the value from the ConnectionString option.
  eg, if normal connection string is "DSN=MyDsn;DATABASE=MyDb"
  and ConnectionString is "DATABASE=OtherDb",
  then the Odbc connect string will become "DSN=MyDsn;DATABASE=OtherDb"
  I think that's what it does.
  But I don't know why Vadim has added this.
+ Extra tracing
+ coIgnoreUnknownFieldType default value is ON

Version 2.012, 2003-12-10  [ Edward Benson ]
-------------------------
+ Simplify explanations of _MIXED_FETCH_ and _MULTIROWS_FETCH_
+ coIgnoreUnknownFieldType default value is OFF
  except Informix, which has default value ON.
+ _DENT_ conditional define [Dmitry Arefiev]

      Schema name; NULL if not applicable to the data source.
3.  TABLE_NAME        Varchar
      Table name
4.  COLUMN_NAME       Varchar not NULL
      Column name. Empty string for a column that does not have a name
5.  DATA_TYPE         Smallint not NULL
      SQL data type
6.  TYPE_NAME         Varchar not NULL
      Data source  dependent data type name
7.  COLUMN_SIZE       Integer
     Column Size
     If DATA_TYPE is SQL_CHAR or SQL_VARCHAR, then this column contains the
     maximum length in characters of the column
     For datetime data types, this is the total number of characters required
     to display the value when converted to characters.
     For numeric data types, this is either the total number of digits or the total
     number of bits allowed in the column, according to the NUM_PREC_RADIX column
8.  BUFFER_LENGTH     Integer
      The length in bytes of data transferred on SqlFetch etc if SQL_C_DEFAULT is specified
9.  DECIMAL_DIGITS    Smallint
      The total number of significant digits to the right of the decimal point
10. NUM_PREC_RADIX    Smallint
      For numeric data types, either 10 or 2.
11. NULLABLE          Smallint not NULL
      SQL_NO_NULLS / SQL_NULLABLE / SQL_NULLABLE_UNKNOWN
12. REMARKS           Varchar
      A description of the column
13. COLUMN_DEF        Varchar
      The default value of the column
14. SQL_DATA_TYPE     Smallint not NULL
     SQL data type,
     This column is the same as the DATA_TYPE column, with the exception of
     datetime and interval data types.
     This column returns the nonconcise data type (such as SQL_DATETIME or SQL_INTERVAL),
     rather than the concise data type (such as SQL_TYPE_DATE or SQL_INTERVAL_YEAR_TO_MONTH)
15. SQL_DATETIME_SUB  Smallint
      The subtype code for datetime and interval data types.
      For other data types, this column returns a NULL.
16. CHAR_OCTET_LENGTH Integer
      The maximum length in bytes of a Character or binary data type column.
17. ORDINAL_POSITION  Integer not NULL
      The ordinal position of the column in the table
18. IS_NULLABLE       Varchar
      'NO' if the column does not include NULLs
      'YES' if the column could include NULLs
      zero-length string if nullability is unknown.

        NULL is returned if an index qualifier is not supported by the data source
        or if TYPE is SQL_TABLE_STAT.
        If a non-null value is returned in this column, it must be used to qualify
        the index name on a DROP INDEX statement; otherwise the TABLE_SCHEM
        should be used to qualify the index name.

        Column name.
        If the column is based on an expression, such as SALARY + BENEFITS,
        the expression is returned;
        if the expression cannot be determined, an empty string is returned.
        NULL is returned if TYPE is SQL_TABLE_STAT.
  10. ASC_OR_DESC      Char(1)         Sort sequence for the column;
       'A' for ascending; 'D' for descending;
       NULL is returned if column sort sequence is not supported by the
       data source or if TYPE is SQL_TABLE_STAT.
  11. CARDINALITY      Integer         Cardinality of table or index;
       number of rows in table if TYPE is SQL_TABLE_STAT;
       number of unique values in the index if TYPE is not SQL_TABLE_STAT;

ODBC result set columns from SQLProcedureColumns
 1.  PROCEDURE_CAT        Varchar
       Procedure catalog name; NULL if not applicable to the data source.
 2.  PROCEDURE_SCHEM      Varchar
       Procedure schema name; NULL if not applicable to the data source.
 3.  PROCEDURE_NAME       Varchar not NULL
       Procedure name. An empty string is returned for a procedure
       that does not have a name.
 4.  COLUMN_NAME          Varchar not NULL
       Procedure column name. The driver returns an empty string for
       a procedure column that does not have a name.
 5.  COLUMN_TYPE          Smallint not NULL
       Defines the procedure column as a parameter or a result set column:
       SQL_PARAM_TYPE_UNKNOWN: The procedure column is a parameter whose type is unknown
       SQL_PARAM_INPUT:        The procedure column is an input parameter
       SQL_PARAM_INPUT_OUTPUT: The procedure column is an input/output parameter
       SQL_PARAM_OUTPUT:       The procedure column is an output parameter
       SQL_RETURN_VALUE:       The procedure column is the return value of the procedure
       SQL_RESULT_COL:         The procedure column is a result set column
 6.  DATA_TYPE            Smallint not NULL
       SQL data type. This can be an ODBC SQL data type or a driver-specific SQL data type.
       For datetime and interval data types, this column returns the concise
       data types (for example, SQL_TYPE_TIME or SQL_INTERVAL_YEAR_TO_MONTH)
 7.  TYPE_NAME            Varchar not NULL
       Data source  dependent data type name
 8.  COLUMN_SIZE          Integer
       The column size of the procedure column on the data source.
       NULL is returned for data types where column size is not applicable.
       For more information concerning precision, see 'Column Size, Decimal
       Digits, Transfer Octet Length, and Display Size,' in Appendix D, 'Data Types.'
 9.  BUFFER_LENGTH        Integer
      The length in bytes of data transferred on an SQLGetData or SQLFetch
      operation if SQL_C_DEFAULT is specified.
      For numeric data, this size may be different than the size of the data
      stored on the data source.
      For more information concerning precision, see 'Column Size, Decimal
      Digits, Transfer Octet Length, and Display Size,' in Appendix D, 'Data Types.'
 10. DECIMAL_DIGITS       Smallint
      The decimal digits of the procedure column on the data source.
      NULL is returned for data types where decimal digits is not applicable.
      For more information concerning decimal digits, see 'Column Size, Decimal
      Digits, Transfer Octet Length, and Display Size,' in Appendix D, 'Data Types.'
 11. NUM_PREC_RADIX       Smallint
      For numeric data types, either 10 or 2.
      If it is 10, the values in COLUMN_SIZE and DECIMAL_DIGITS give the number
      of decimal digits allowed for the column.
      For example, a DECIMAL(12,5) column would return a NUM_PREC_RADIX of 10,
      a COLUMN_SIZE of 12, and a DECIMAL_DIGITS of 5;
      a FLOAT column could return a NUM_PREC_RADIX of 10, a COLUMN_SIZE of 15
      and a DECIMAL_DIGITS of NULL.
      If it is 2, the values in COLUMN_SIZE and DECIMAL_DIGITS give the number
      of bits allowed in the column.
      For example, a FLOAT column could return a NUM_PREC_RADIX of 2,
      a COLUMN_SIZE of 53, and a DECIMAL_DIGITS of NULL.
      NULL is returned for data types where NUM_PREC_RADIX is not applicable.
 12.NULLABLE             Smallint not NULL
     Whether the procedure column accepts a NULL value:
     SQL_NO_NULLS: The procedure column does not accept NULL values.
     SQL_NULLABLE: The procedure column accepts NULL values.
     SQL_NULLABLE_UNKNOWN: It is not known if the procedure column accepts NULL values.
 13.REMARKS              Varchar
      A description of the procedure column.
 14.COLUMN_DEF           Varchar
     The default value of the column.
     If NULL was specified as the default value, then this column is
     the word NULL, not enclosed in quotation marks.
     If the default value cannot be represented without truncation, then this
     column contains TRUNCATED, with no enclosing single quotation marks.
     If no default value was specified, then this column is NULL.
     The value of COLUMN_DEF can be used in generating a new column definition,
     except when it contains the value TRUNCATED.
 15.SQL_DATA_TYPE        Smallint not NULL
      The value of the SQL data type as it appears in the SQL_DESC_TYPE field
      of the descriptor.
      This column is the same as the DATA_TYPE column, except for datetime and
      interval data types.
      For datetime and interval data types, the SQL_DATA_TYPE field in the
      result set will return SQL_INTERVAL or SQL_DATETIME,
      and the SQL_DATETIME_SUB field will return the subcode for the
      specific interval or datetime data type (see Appendix D, Data Types).
 16.SQL_DATETIME_SUB     Smallint
      The subtype code for datetime and interval data types.
      For other data types, this column returns a NULL.
 17.CHAR_OCTET_LENGTH    Integer
      The maximum length in bytes of a character or binary data type column.
      For all other data types, this column returns a NULL.
 18.ORDINAL_POSITION     Integer not NULL
     For input and output parameters, the ordinal position of the parameter
     in the procedure definition (in increasing parameter order, starting at 1).
     For a return value (if any), 0 is returned.
     For result-set columns, the ordinal position of the column in the result set,
     with the first column in the result set being number 1.
     If there are multiple result sets, column ordinal positions are returned in
     a driver-specific manner.
 19.IS_NULLABLE          Varchar
      'NO' if the column does not include NULLs.
      'YES' if the column can include NULLs.
      This column returns a zero-length string if nullability is unknown.
      ISO rules are followed to determine nullability.
      An ISO SQL  compliant DBMS cannot return an empty string.
      The value returned for this column is different from the value returned
      for the NULLABLE column. (See the description of the NULLABLE column.)
